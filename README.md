# Azure Maps MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides **Azure Maps** functionality as tools for Large Language Models (LLMs). This server exposes the full range of Azure Maps services including search, routing, rendering, and geolocation capabilities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Azure Maps MCP Server** is currently in preview. You can expect changes prior to the MCP server becoming generally available.
> You should avoid using this MCP server preview in production apps.

## Overview

This project implements an MCP server using Azure Functions that integrates with Azure Maps services and comprehensive country data. It allows LLMs to perform a wide range of geographic operations including:

- **Geocoding & Search**: Convert addresses or place names to coordinates and vice versa
- **Routing**: Calculate routes, travel times and reachable areas
- **Map Rendering**: Generate map tiles and static map images
- **Geolocation**: Determine country codes and location info from IP addresses
- **Country Intelligence**: Access comprehensive country information

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Tools

Interact with these Azure Maps services through the following MCP tools:

### üîç Search & Geocoding

**search_geocoding**: Convert street addresses, landmarks, or place names into precise geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). Handles various address formats and returns detailed address components with confidence scores.

**search_geocoding_reverse**: Convert geographic coordinates into human-readable street addresses and location details. Essential for location-based applications displaying meaningful address information from GPS coordinates.

**search_polygon**: Retrieve administrative boundary polygons for geographic locations such as city limits, postal code areas, state/province boundaries, or country borders. Returns precise polygon coordinates for spatial analysis.

**search_country_info**: Get comprehensive country information including demographics, geography, economics, and cultural data by ISO country code. Returns languages, currencies, time zones, calling codes, and more.

**search_countries**: Find countries by name, continent, or other criteria. Helps discover countries matching specific geographic, cultural, or economic characteristics.

### üõ£Ô∏è Routing & Navigation

**routing_directions**: Calculate detailed driving/walking/cycling directions between geographic coordinates. Returns comprehensive route information including distance, travel time, turn-by-turn navigation, and route geometry.

**routing_matrix**: Calculate travel times and distances between multiple origin and destination points in matrix format. Essential for delivery route planning, finding closest locations, and logistics optimization.

**routing_range**: Calculate geographic areas reachable within specified time or distance limits from a starting point. Creates isochrone/isodistance polygons for service area analysis and accessibility studies.

**routing_countries**: Analyze routes and identify all countries the route passes through. Valuable for international travel planning, customs preparation, and cross-border logistics.

### üñºÔ∏è Map Rendering

**render_staticmap**: Generate custom static map images for specified geographic areas with optional markers and path overlays. Creates publication-ready map images perfect for reports, documentation, and presentations.

### üåê Geolocation & IP Analysis

**geolocation_ip**: Get country code and location information (ISO code, country name, continent) for a given IP address. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

**geolocation_ip_batch**: Get country codes and location information for multiple IP addresses in a single request. Efficiently processes up to 100 IP addresses at once.

**geolocation_ip_validate**: Validate IP address format and get comprehensive technical information. Returns validation status, address family, scope information, and technical details.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
- Azure Maps subscription key

## Setup

### 1. Get Azure Maps Subscription Key

1. Create an Azure Maps account in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Create a new Azure Maps resource
3. Copy the subscription key from the resource's authentication settings

### 2. Configure Environment

Create or update the `source/local.settings.json` file with your Azure Maps subscription key:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "None",
    "AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType": "Files",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
    "AZURE_MAPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY": "<your-azure-maps-subscription-key-here>"
  }
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Never commit your actual subscription key to version control. Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault for production deployments.

## Building the Project

### Clean and Build
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd source

# Clean the project
dotnet clean

# Restore dependencies and build
dotnet build
```

### Using VS Code Tasks
If you're using VS Code, you can use the predefined tasks:
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí "build (functions)"

## Running the Server

### Local Development

#### Option 1: Using Azure Functions Core Tools
```bash
# Navigate to the source directory
cd source

# Build the project first
dotnet build

# Start the function host
cd bin/Debug/net9.0
func host start
```

#### Option 2: Using VS Code
- Press `F5` or use "Run and Debug" in VS Code
- Or run the task: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí "func: host start"

#### Option 3: Using .NET CLI
```bash
# Navigate to the source directory
cd source

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

The server will start on the default port (typically 7071 for Azure Functions, or 7174 as configured in launch settings).

### Production Deployment

#### Azure Functions
Deploy to Azure Functions for production use:

```bash
# Publish the project
dotnet publish --configuration Release

# Deploy using Azure Functions Core Tools
func azure functionapp publish your-function-app-name
```
